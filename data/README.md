tungdzih translator

# DONE
- users shouldn't be able to type in *


# TODO
- make sure theres spacing added after words that don't get translated
- add support for jp kanji
- have multiple possible spellings appear on hover?
- update UI: maybe something similar to google translate's detect language feature
  - one box where a user can type in characters (highlight whether it is simplified, trad, jp)
  - tungdzih translation appears to the right?

# other features to potentially implement
- translate website
- estimate translations FROM tungdzih
